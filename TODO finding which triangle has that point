kiss triangle ke undar hai point uska bhi code likhe

U have


typedef struct {
	float	x, y;
} del_point2d_t;
vector<del_point2d_t> ball_pos
+
struct triangle{
int sides[3];
};

vector <triangle> traingles

in which each member contains 3 index representing index of ball_pos vector

expected output
a struct triangle
